# Dynamic Learning Model
A Dynamic Learning Model (DLM) utilizes a hybrid approach to learning and responding to queries, making it smarter and more knowledgeable in responding to various FAQs about a topic on which it has been trained. For my purpose, I am training this bot with college-related questions that might be useful for any university institution.

NOTICE: You'll need to install, import, and configure your device to "SpaCy" for this bot to be used in programs (only for developers)
