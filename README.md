# Dynamic_Learning_Model
A Dynamic Learning Model (DLM) utilizes a heuristic-based query learning algorithm that gets smarter and more knowledgable in responding to various queries the more you ask it questions
A great example is how humans learn how to respond to questions the more they get exposure to it and learn how to answer questions appropriately
