# Dynamic Learning Model
A Dynamic Learning Model (DLM) utilizes a heuristic-based query learning algorithm that gets smarter and more knowledgeable in responding to various queries about a topic it has been trained on. For my purpose, I am training this bot with college-related questions that might be useful for any student.

NOTICE: You'll need to install and import "Spacy" for this bot to work
