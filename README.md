# Dynamic Learning Model
A Dynamic Learning Model (DLM) utilizes a hybrid approach to learning and responding to queries, making it smarter and more knowledgeable in responding to various FAQs about a topic it has been trained on. For my purpose, I am training this bot with college-related questions that might be useful for any university institution. 

* This model uses SpaCy & SQLite for many of its functions

NOTICE: You'll need to install, import, and configure your device to "SpaCy" and possibly SQLlite for this bot to be used in programs (only for developers)
