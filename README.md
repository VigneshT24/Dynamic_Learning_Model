# Dynamic Learning Model
A Dynamic Learning Model (DLM) utilizes a heuristic-based query learning algorithm that gets smarter and more knowledgable in responding to various queries in a topic it has been trained on. For my purpose, I am training this bot with college-related questions that might be useful for any students.

THIS BOT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. This is due to the progressive learning nature of this DLM bot, which means that it might not know EVERYTHING but knows the basics in most topics. The more this bot is used, the more its DLM_database fills up with new Q/A pairs that it hasn't encountered yet.
