# Dynamic Learning Model
A Dynamic Learning Model (DLM) utilizes a heuristic-based query learning algorithm that gets smarter and more knowledgable in responding to various queries the more you ask it questions
A great analogy to this bot is how humans learn how to respond to questions the more they get exposed to them and learn how to answer questions appropriately


THIS BOT IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. This is due to the progressive learning nature of this DLM bot, which means that it might not know EVERYTHING but knows the basics in most topics. The more this bot is used, the more its DLM_database fills up with new Q/A pairs that it hasn't encountered yet.
