# Dynamic Learning Model
A Dynamic Learning Model (DLM) employs a hybrid AI approach to learning and responding to queries, enabling it to become smarter and more knowledgeable in addressing various FAQs related to a topic it has been trained on. Additionally, it can perform non-ambiguous arithmetic and conversion problems while executing a Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Currently, the database is filled with general college-related information to assist college students and university institutions.

* This model uses SpaCy, SQLite, & NLTK for many of its functions

NOTICE: You'll need to install, import, and configure your device to "SpaCy", "NLTK", and possibly SQLite for this bot to be used in programs (only for developers)
